# OpenCat Experiments

This repository is a for my own personal experiments with [Nybble](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/nybble-world-s-cutest-open-source-robotic-kitten/x/19663866#/), *The world's cutest robotic kitten you can build* designed by [Petoi](https://www.petoi.com).

I make no promises that anything here will be useful, work, make the world a better place, make the world a worse place, or do anything other then provide me with entertainment and track some of my meanderings as I experiment with Nybble.

You're welcome to peruse and use anything you find here, but I make no promises and provide no guarantees. All of the code here is provided "As-Is" under the MIT License outlined below, unless otherwise specified in the specific file or folder.

If you do use any substantial portion in your own work or experimentation, I would *love* to hear about it, but this is not required, just a personal request.
